# âœ¨ ApiB Documentation âœ¨

Welcome to **ApiB** â€“ an innovative project that automates the creation of working shift schedules for two supermarket hubs. Designed with efficiency in mind, ApiB integrates modern web interfaces and a robust backend to streamline scheduling and meet legal work constraints.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**ApiB** leverages MongoDB as its primary database and offers three distinct interfaces:

- **Student/Worker Interface:**  
  Allows users to log in and upload their available dates and times for work.

- **Manager Interface:**  
  Enables managers to specify staffing needs by hub, setting the required number of personnel per day along with time ranges.

- **Workflow Interface:**  
  Automatically generates the working shift schedule based on the collected data and defined constraints.

The backend (code omitted for security reasons) utilizes the **ortools** library to enforce constraints such as:
- Maximum working days and hours per week
- Mandatory 11-hour breaks between shifts  
- And other legal work regulations
